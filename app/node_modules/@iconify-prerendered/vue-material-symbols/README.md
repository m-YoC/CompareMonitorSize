# Material Symbols components for Vue

Designed for ease of use and high performance. Each icon in set is standalone
component.

## Features

- **Easy to use**
  - No plugins required! Compatible with any build tools.
  - Zero dependencies.
  - SSR / SSG friendly.
  - TypeScript support.
- **High performance**
  - Does not require any external resources like fonts, css, images.
  - The icon code is embedded in your bundle.
  - Supports tree shaking, so only those icons that you have used will be
    included in the bundle.
  - Works offline.
- Powered by [iconify](https://iconify.design/).

## Usage

```vue
<script setup>
// Import components as usual
import {
	IconDownloading,
	IconPrivacyTip,
	IconFilterDramaOutline,
} from 'vue-material-symbols'
</script>

<template>
	<!-- And just use it in template -->
  	<IconDownloading/>
	<IconPrivacyTip/>
	<IconFilterDramaOutline/>
</template>
```

Only these three icons will be included in your bundle. All other icons may be
tree-shaken by your bundler.

That's all you need. No plugins, extra configs, IDE extensions or something
else.
